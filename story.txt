interpreter:

"Holy L what the hell"

Expressing shock or disbelief, like saying, "Wow, this is such a loss or surprise!"
"Why didn't they tell us this in the course?"

Frustration over a perceived gap in the course material or teaching.
"Or maybe I wasn't listening, nah can't be"

Brief self-reflection, questioning if they missed it themselves, followed by dismissing the idea because they believe they were paying attention.
"Wey be dat ting"

"What is that thing?" A rhetorical way of expressing confusion or trying to figure something out.
"Wagwan mon mate make me mad lad I tel ya dat lad"

Playful or dramatic venting in slang:
"Wagwan" (whatâ€™s going on) is Caribbean slang.
The rest reads as casual, exaggerated frustration with "mate" and "lad" showing a British influence, likely for comedic effect.

Summary:
This is someone venting humorously about discovering something surprising they feel should have been covered in a course. They're frustrated but also having fun with the way they express it.
